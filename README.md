# Newsweek Clone

This project entails replicating the Newsweek homepage as it appeared on January 20, 2021, with the primary objective of mastering the Bootstrap framework's responsive design capabilities. By reconstructing a real-world, content-rich website, the project offers practical experience in implementing Bootstrap's grid system, navigation components, and utility classes to achieve a responsive and visually consistent layout across various devices.
